# CS5463-Embedded-System-Final-Project
## Requirements:
Please use interrupts to realize the following functions:
1) The LCD displays the temperature in oF when button 1 is pressed.
2) The LCD displays the temperature in oC when button 2 is pressed.
3) Create an array of size 10 in FIFO structure to store the temperatures in oC sampled during
past 10 seconds (one per second).
4) When computer sends a command (You can design the command as you like) through UART
to the board, the cpu on the board will calculate the average of the 10 temperatures in oC
collected in the past 10 seconds). The board will then send back the result to your computer.

If you finish the four functions correctly, your group will get full marks for this project.
If you could implement any further function to the system such as follows, you will get bonus.
Bonus tasks: (Will give your some examples soonâ€¦)
1) task scheduling:
2) ..
3) ..
